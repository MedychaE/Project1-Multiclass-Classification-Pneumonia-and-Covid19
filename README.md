# Project1-Multiclass-Classification-Pneumonia-and-Covid19
My very first project to create deep learning algorithm for multiclass classification which try to differentiate between Covid19, Pneumonia, and healthy. There are three machine learning algorithms names ResNet50, VGG16  and Exception.  I make comparison between them in the context of evaluation results. For training and testing i used labeled MRI dataset.
Those have very poorly results because i forgot to change the size of input pixel at that moment.
