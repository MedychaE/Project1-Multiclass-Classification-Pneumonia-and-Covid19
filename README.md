# Project1-Multiclass-Classification-Pneumonia-and-Covid19
In this project i make some algorithm for multiclass classification which try to differentiate between Covid19, Pneumonia, and healthy. There are three machine learning algorithms names ResNet50, VGG16  and Exception.  I make comparison between them in the context of evaluation results. For training and testing i used labeled MRI dataset.
